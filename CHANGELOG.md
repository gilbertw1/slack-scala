1.0.0 (2024-05-08)
------------------

Starting this release I think:

(this is I how read the symptoms observed, mostly limited by the Play library)

Since `0.2.4` the library sends a ping message to Slack every minute. Pong
message is received (but not checked upon). That is to sustain a Slack
websocket connection even if idle - see [Slack doc for ping and pong](https://api.slack.com/rtm#ping_and_pong).

Previously the library caused the client to reconnect every 1 or 2 minute
with the following messages:
```
[WebSocketClientActor] WebSocket disconnected.
[SlackRtmConnectionActor] WebSocket Client disconnected, reconnecting
[SlackRtmConnectionActor] Starting web socket client
```
